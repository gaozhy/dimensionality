we get j-1* m-1 correlation coefficients

for sess in outer:
	for j_val in inner:
		- we fisher transform
		- average across j-1 partitions (within dim)

	- bestN for sess = choose the dim with the best zcorrelation.

	- average the training and validation data
	- SVD
	- reconstruct
	- correlate with test (note this is part of 
"reconstruct" function... terrible name)


we end up with 
- j dim estimates per sub (not j * (j-1)?)
- j r estimates per sub
