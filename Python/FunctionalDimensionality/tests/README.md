# Testing
The tests in this directory can be run one level up (so from ```./Python/FunctionalDimensionality/```) using ```python``` or ```python3 tests/test.py```. An easier way to do this is by calling ```make test``` from the top directory. You will need to ```pip``` or ```pip3 install coverage codecov``` first though for the Makefile to run the tests.

Check the status of the test results locally using the above instructions. When the tests are OK, feel free to push to github and [the report on TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/lovelabUCL/dimensionality) will update automatically for the pushed branch.
